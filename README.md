# NOMAD v2.1 — Field Agent Node

> A portable, secure, and modular reconnaissance & analysis toolkit for low-profile digital operations. Designed for signal awareness, system profiling, and offline intelligence gathering.

---

## 🌐 Project Description

**NOMAD** is a lightweight, tactical field node built on Raspberry Pi Zero or similar ARM devices. It is designed for:

- Passive signal intelligence (Wi-Fi, BLE, GPS)
- LAN recon & device mapping
- Trap mode (honeypot ops)
- Session logging & report generation
- Secure emergency wipe
- Offline use, air-gapped ready

All sessions are timestamped, structured, and locally stored — no cloud, no dependencies.

## 🧰 Modes & Tools

### 1. 🛰️ Recon Mode
- Maps local subnet, devices, and ports
- Captures nearby Wi-Fi networks
- Scans BLE and GPS (if enabled)
- Auto-labels MACs by vendor
- Stores full session logs and summaries

### 2. 📡 Signal Analyzer
- Wi-Fi signal snapshot
- BLE beacon scanner
- Signal strength monitoring over time
- Interface health and RF state
- Combines into one `signal_report.txt`

### 3. 🎯 Trap Mode (Coming)
- Fake AP or honeypot mode
- Device attraction + behavior logging

### 4. 🔍 Device Profiler
- Gathers internal hardware + OS stats
- CPU, memory, uptime, MACs, open ports

### 5. 🗃️ Session Summary
- Browse past session logs easily

### 6. 🔥 Emergency Wipe
- Securely delete all ops & logs

## 📁 Data Structure

All logs are saved in organized folders:

```bash
data/
├── sessions/         # Recon sessions
├── signal_logs/      # Signal Analyzer logs
├── gps/              # GPS NMEA or parsed
├── vault/            # Sensitive exports
